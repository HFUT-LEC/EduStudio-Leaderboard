# Backend of EduStudio Leaderboard

## Upload Your Log Folder
In order to support all users in uploading their own experiment results, we provide a portable processing flow. In EduStudio, each experiment eventually forms a specific log directory. After users submit their own experiment log directory to the specific github repository, the python script will automatically process the new experiments and convert them into json files required by Leaderboard front-end, and the Leaderboard front-end will automatically display the new experimental results according to the json files.
